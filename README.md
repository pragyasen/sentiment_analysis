# Sentiment Analysis
Performed sentiment analysis on restaurant reviews using two different approaches: a traditional machine learning model (Naive Bayes) and a modern deep learning model (BERT). Provided an interactive visualization using Gradio for end-user interpretation.

## Dataset used
Restaurant review dataset (from Kaggle): 1000 records, 2 fields

## Concepts Covered
1. Naïve Bayesian
2. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
3. Gradio

## Implementation Steps
1. Data Pre-processing
2. Naïve Bayesian model for Sentiment Analysis
3. BERT model for Sentiment Analysis
4. Comparison of performance metrics
5. Gradio for Visual representation
